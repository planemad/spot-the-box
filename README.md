## About

There are over 200k United State Postal Service collection boxes across the United States. Recent news has reported some of these boxes are being removed, moved or locked ahead of the upcoming 2020 election. Spot the Box takes a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) data dump of all USPS collection boxes and also users to groundtruth whether their local USPS collection box(es) have been removed, rendered unusable or have remained unchanged.

## Data

The data used in Spot the Box comes from a FOIA request in August 2019. The data file includes 205,241 USPS collection boxes, both USPS Blue Boxes and Boxes located in Post Office Lobbies.
